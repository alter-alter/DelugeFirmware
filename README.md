### Master Compressor
In the Song view, select Affect Entire and SIDECHAIN modulation button, and adjust the upper gold knob. Push the upper gold knob to switch to the next parameter (Threshold (dB), Makeup Gain (dB), Attack (ms), Release (ms), Ratio, MIX). The LEDs next to the knob act as a gain reduction meter.<br>

You can also use Shift + \[SIDECHAIN: →11↓8 to →11↓3\] pads to select parameters.

\*This feature can be turned On/Off in the runtime feature setting.

### Manual slicing / Lazy chop
In the Slicer view, press the ◀&#xFE0E;▶&#xFE0E; knob. When you press the green pad in the bottom left, it starts playing the first slice, and pressing an empty pad creates a new slice. Turning the Select knob to the left or pressing the Pad + DELETE button allows you to delete a slice.

Turning the ◀&#xFE0E;▶&#xFE0E; knob allows you to adjust the start point of the slice. Additionally, turning the ▼&#xFE0E;▲&#xFE0E; knob transposes the slice.
